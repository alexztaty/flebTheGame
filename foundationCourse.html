The Foundation year at Manchester is widely regarded to be one of the greatest in the country, as you are treated with the same respect as any other student and are taught by the same staff who teach the degree you will be proceeding onto. The foundation year is year 1 of a 4- or 5-year course.

<p>
Foundation Year is a great opportunity for anyone who has had to take time out of education, people who were unable to thrive in their A Level environment, and people who have changed their mind about what they would like to do as a career and want to start something new.
<p>
Upon meeting the progression criteria, you will be guaranteed a place on your course for the next year. With some courses requiring up to A*A*A, the foundation year is not easy; it is designed to prepare students for their course.

The progressions for each department are different as there are different entry requirements for each degree. Each department will have different options available to them, chosen as they are the most relevant for that degree. For example, Physics must choose the Physics 3 module whereas this is replaced with Computational Thinking for Computer Science.

In order to progress to the course, the above flowchart must be met. 
<p>
In the first semester, the foundation year covers mathematics, physics, chemistry, academic skills, and ICT. This will help to lay the foundation for knowledge you will be building on for your time at the University of Manchester.
<p>
In the second semester, this knowledge is expanded through further modules that are more relevant to your chosen progression subject.
<p>
The learning experience is very different to Sixth Form. It is incredibly independent and if you donâ€™t put the effort in then you will struggle to complete all the assignments. There are courseworks due every week so falling behind more than a couple of days will put you at a huge disadvantage.
<p>
<p>
The foundation year makes use of a relatively new (to STEM subjects) method of learning called blended learning. Blended learning is where the information relevant to the course for each week is released at the start of the week, and the in-person sessions later in the week work on the expectation that each person has already reviewed the content released online, meaning that students are given the opportunity to work things out for themselves, and the lectures and tutorials can go into more detail on the subject.
<p>
Each subject will have some additional reading recommendations. These can be accessed via the University Library system, which students learn about in the ICT course in the first semester.
